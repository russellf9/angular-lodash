# Using Lo-dash with Angular

This project is just a simple test in how best to use [Lo-dash](https://lodash.com) with Angular.js. I've based the injection method from that described in: [Creating And Extending A Lodash / Underscore Service In AngularJS](http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2720-creating-and-extending-a-lodash-underscore-service-in-angularjs.htm)


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
